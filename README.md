# Hungry_Bird
eYRC 2018-19 codes for the theme 'Hungry Bird'. The objective was to emulate the flight patterns of birds. 

final.lua is the lua code for the path planning simulation using V-Rep which makes use of the VREP_ROS_Interface. path_planning.py subscribes to the topics that gives data on the drone's current position and path points in the simulation environment. It then subscribes to these path coordinates and executes them using the PID controller.
